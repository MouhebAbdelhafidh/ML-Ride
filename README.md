## ðŸ“œ Introduction
Welcome to **ML Ride** â€“ a personal journey through the exciting world of Machine Learning! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my ongoing exploration of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. Whether you're a beginner, enthusiast, or seasoned professional, you'll find valuable resources, tutorials, and projects here to aid your ML learning process.

What you'll find here:
ðŸ“š Learning Resources: Curated articles, research papers, ...
ðŸ§  Algorithms: Machine learning code implementations.
ðŸ”¬ Mini Projects: Practical projects to apply theoretical knowledge.

## ðŸ“‹ Usage
To get the most of this repository it's best to follow theses steps:
1. Visit the [MLS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ghassen-fatnassi/mls) and take a look at the **MLS RoadMap**
2. For each step return to **ML Ride** for additional resources, such as research papers, practical projects, notes, and other insights Iâ€™ve gathered during my ML learning journey.
**Note**: Some ML algorithms are not mentioned in [MLS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ghassen-fatnassi/mls) resources so I try to cover them in details inside this repository.
3. Read the articles for better basic algorithms understanding, take a look at the research papers for deeper understanding of real world problems and try implementing these projects on your own to gain hands-on experience.
