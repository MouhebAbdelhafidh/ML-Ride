!	If you have read papers or articles about Decision Tree surely you have remarqued that Decision Tree is not a final model yet  it is used in other bigger models like Random Forest..
! 	The goal of this project is to implement Classification Decision Tree model 

***	This is the ML process that I followed in this small classification project**
1. Data Exploration
2. Handling missing data
3. Feature engineering
4. Decision Tree Classification model
5. Testing on new piece of data
